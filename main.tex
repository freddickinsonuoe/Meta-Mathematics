\begin{quote}
    \textit{This is a project in mathematics education, undertaking a survey of "meta-mathematical problems". That is, the mathematics needed to set feasible mathematics questions. For example, a teacher wanting to write exercises on the Pythagorean Theorem will seek right-angled triangles with integer sides, e.g. 3,4,5 triangles. This project will survey papers in this field, and collect together key mathematics which teachers regularly need in order to set problems. Note, this project will require some elementary number theory.}

\section{Reading Material}

\subsection{AI Cuoco (2000): Meta-Problems in Mathematics}
``Problems that come out nice allow students to concentrate on important ideas rather than messy calculations". We call the idea of making up a nice problem a ``meta-problem". Algebra and number theory are key for the creation of a lot of meta-problems - Cuoco explores a few examples.

\subsubsection{Pythagorean Triples}
Suppose you're a secondary school teacher looking to teach the Pythagoras theorem. Nice numbers allow students to focus on the problem at hand, rather than getting bogged down in complicated arithmetic.\\\\
Recall that any scalar multiplication of a Pythagorean triple gives a new triple;
\begin{equation*}
    (da)^2 + (db)^2 = d^2(a^2 + b^2) = d^2(c^2) = (dc)^2
\end{equation*}
so the bigger question is looking for \textbf{primitive} Pythagorean triples. One method for this is using Euclid's formula (as seen before in number theory);
\begin{thm}[Euclid's Formula for PPT's]{}{}
If $m$ and $n$ are two \textbf{odd integers} such that $m > n$ then the triple $(a, b, c)$ formed
\begin{equation*}
    a = mn,\quad b = \frac{m^2 - n^2}{2},\quad c = \frac{m^2 + n^2}{2}
\end{equation*}
is indeed a Pythagorean triple. This triple is primitive if and only if $m$ and $n$ are coprime; in fact, every PPT arises from coprime odd $m > n > 0$.
\end{thm}
\textit{*note - there is a technicality in the changing of $a$ and $b$.}\\\\
We can use computers to help us generate any Pythagorean triple suitable for class problems. See the next page for an example script.\\\\
\hl{Including the script in \LaTeX{} is not pretty so I've deleted it for now, but I have it on my Jupyter Notebook.}

\subsection{Mansfield (2017) \& Robson (2001): Plimpton 322}
The Plimpton 322 is a Babylonian clay tablet with four rows and fifteen columns of various numbers. Robson (2001) provides a ``re-assessment" of what the content of the tablet means. Mansfield does similar, quoting
\begin{quote}
    \textit{``we propose that P322 is a different kind of trigonometric table which lists right triangles with long side 1, exact short side $\beta$ and exact diagonal $\beta$ – in place of the approximations $\sin(\theta)$ and $\cos(\theta)$".}
\end{quote}
They are both quite historical papers with less mathematical content than others.

\subsection{Steele (2003): Setting Linear Algebra Problems}
\textit{``I was disappointed by the level of arithmetic competence of my students, and annoyed to find that problems were being set where this lack of competence meant one could never really see whether students understood the material and techniques or not"} - the same rationale as Cuoco in setting problems that allow students to focus on the problem at hand.\\\\
Provides methods for coming up with nice problems for various linear algebra topics. Occasionally makes use of MAPLE.

\subsubsection{Vectors of Integer Norm}
In $\R^2$ this is simply finding Pythagorean triples. He also makes use of Lagrange's theorem;
\begin{thm}[Lagrange's Theorem]{}{}
Any integer can be decomposed into the sum of at most four squares.
\end{thm}
So this is useful for finding vectors $\bm{x} \in \R^4$ with integer norm. \hl{He does not give any detail into how we may decompose these integers.}

\subsubsection{Matrices of a Given Determinant}
Recall the LU factorisation from ILA/NLA/Honours Algebra
\begin{dfn}[\textbf{LU} Factorisation]{}{}
An \textbf{LU factorisation} of some $\bm{A} \in \R^{n\times n}$ is $\bm{A} = \bm{LU}$ where
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=-2mm]
    \item $\bm{L} \in \R^{n \times n}$ is unit lower triangular,
    \item $\bm{U} \in \R^{n \times n}$ is non-singular upper triangular.
\end{enumerate}
\end{dfn}
Unit lower triangular means entries on the diagonal are one. A better decomposition involves a permutation matrix $P$ as \textit{any} matrix can be decomposed into a permutation matrix $P$ and $L$, $U$ as above.\\\\
The most useful way to use the $PLU$ decomposition is to work backwards and create matrices with determinants $\pm1$. This is because of the following theorem. \textit{He does not explicitly go through how to create such matrices but does comment on it.}
\begin{thm}[Inverse of Matrices with Unit Determinants]{}{}
Let $\mathbf{A}$ be a square integer matrix. Then $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$ is an integer matrix iff $\det(\mathbf{A}) = \pm1$.
\end{thm}
\textit{He gives a proof of this theorem.}

\subsubsection{Further Chapters}
He goes through a lot more topics in similar detail. The chapters are
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=-2mm]
    \item matrices with a given kernel,
    \item leontieff input-output matrices,
    \item orthogonal matrices,
    \item gram-schmidt and qr decomposition,
    \item least-squares problems,
    \item householder matrices,
    \item matrices with a given jordan normal form,
    \item orthogonal matrices in $\R^3$,
    \item symmetric matrices with given eigenvalues,
    \item matrices with easily calculated exponential.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Naiman (2022) - Generating Parametrized Linear Systems}
...  for Teaching Linear Algebra.\\\\
Again follows the rationale of creating problems that allow students to focus on the  task at hand instead of arithmetic. This paper focuses on:
\begin{quote}
\textit{For what values of the input parameter $k$, does the following linear system,
    $\mathbf{ax} = b$, have: 
    \begin{enumerate}[itemsep=-2mm]
        \item no solutions,
        \item a unique solution (and what it is),
        \item      an infinite number of solutions (and what they are).
    \end{enumerate}}
\end{quote}
They go through their process and the challenges faced before providing a full algorithm for the problem.

\subsection{Convertito (2016): Building the Biggest Box}
... Three Factor Polynomials and a Diophantine Equation.\\
Read by Lara.

\subsection{Buddenhagen (1992) - Nice Cubic Polynomials and More}
The paper has the intent of providing a systematic and unified presentation for finding ``nice" cubics. Here nice means the roots and critical points are rational numbers with small denominators.\\\\
They go through, using various different parts of mathematics to provide a solution for this problem in quite good depth.


\subsection{Green (1976): The Historical Development of Complex Numbers}
This provides a nice example of Cardano's Method in action and explains its limitations through Cardano's historical context. He notes the lack of information around complex numbers at that time, as Cardano was the first to use $\sqrt{-}$ in a calculation, and the prevalence of strictly positive constants in cubic equations. This led to Cardano describing his method as "refined as it is useless" when he mistakenly converted $\sqrt{-15}$ to $- \sqrt{15}$.
